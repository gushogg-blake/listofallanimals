To add an animal(s) to the list, submit a pull request to this repository adding the animals to `animals`.

- New animals are added at the end, in whatever order you like
- Search for the animal before adding it (alternate names welcome)
- Commit messages can be whatever you want, including advertising for your product/service
- At most 20 new animals can be submitted in each PR

For the purposes of this list, an animal is something you can see and point at, and that has a common name.  Invisible or otherwise obscure animals may be rejected.

### Naming guidelines

- The animal's entry should match what you would say if someone pointed at the animal and said "what's that?"
- No technical/scientific names
- No excessive specifiers, e.g. "Eurasian..."

### Overlapping classifications and alternate names

- Alternate names are welcome - if the list already contains Pigeon, Rock dove can be added.
- Overlapping classifications are also fine, e.g. Bird and Kingfisher or Bear and Polar bear.

### Style & formatting

- Usually only the first letter of the name should be capitalised, e.g. Polar bear not Polar Bear.
- No punctuation, parentheticals, etc.  If these are necessary, the animal might not qualify as being something you can see and point at etc.

### Other rules

- No breeds.  Dogs are dogs.
